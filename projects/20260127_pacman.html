  <p>
    This project was a core part of how I learned foundational AI concepts
    during my time in academia. It was not simply about programming a game,
    but about understanding how classical AI algorithms behave in practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    By implementing informed search, probabilistic reasoning, and reinforcement
    learning strategies, I could directly observe how algorithmic choices
    influenced Pac-Man’s behavior inside the maze.
  </p>

  <p>
    The visual nature of the project made the learning process more intuitive,
    allowing me to focus on problem-solving rather than low-level technical details.
    The complexity of the Pac-Man environment closely mirrors real-world AI challenges.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>
    Download the project and run it locally to explore the behaviors firsthand.
  </p>

  <p class="repo">
    Click the link for: 
    <a href="https://github.com/jaiganesh-vr/the-pacman-project" target="_blank">
      The Pacman
    </a>
    code repository
  </p>

  <h2>Execution instructions</h2>

  <p>
    After downloading and unzipping the Pac-Man project, navigate to the directory
    and start the game by running the following command:
  </p>

  <p>python pacman.py</p>

  <p>
    Pac-Man navigates a maze of corridors and food pellets. The simplest agent,
    <em>GoWestAgent</em>, always moves west and serves as a baseline reflex agent.
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    If Pac-Man gets stuck, exit the game using <strong>CTRL+C</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Search Algorithm Implementation</h2>

  <p>
    The file <em>searchAgents.py</em> contains a fully implemented <em>SearchAgent</em>
    that plans and executes paths through the maze.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each search algorithm returns a sequence of actions that move the agent from
    the start state to the goal, using stacks, queues, or priority queues defined
    in <em>util.py</em>.
  </p>

    <li><strong>A* Search</strong> — Uses heuristics to guide efficient exploration.</li>

        class="post-hero"
    />
    </a>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Custom search strategies can be added by defining a new function and
    integrating it into the agent configuration.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges in Solving the Maze</h2>

<ul class="post-list">
<li>
    <strong>Finding All the Corners</strong> — Requires Pac-Man to visit all four
    corners of the maze. The key challenge is designing a state representation
    that accurately tracks which corners have already been reached.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Corner Problem with Heuristics</strong> — Introduces heuristic functions
    to guide search more efficiently. Admissible and consistent heuristics ensure
    optimal solutions while significantly reducing unnecessary exploration.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Eating All the Dots</strong> — The most challenging task, where Pac-Man
    must collect all food pellets in the fewest possible steps. This problem is
    formalized using the <em>FoodSearchProblem</em>.
</li>
</ul>
