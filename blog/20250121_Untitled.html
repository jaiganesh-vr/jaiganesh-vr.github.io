  <!-- Intro -->
  <p>
    Short, sharp intro that frames the problem, tension, or question.
    This is where you hook the reader without trying too hard.
  </p>

  <!-- Section -->
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Explain the context. What’s broken? What’s misunderstood?
    Assume the reader is smart but busy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add a second paragraph when the idea needs room to breathe.
    Your spacing already does the heavy lifting.
  </p>

  <!-- Section -->
  <h2>The Core Idea</h2>

  <p>
    This is the main insight. The thing you actually care about.
    If someone only reads this section, they should walk away smarter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use examples. Trade-offs. Clear thinking.
    No buzzwords unless they earn rent.
  </p>

  <!-- Callout -->
  <p class="muted">
    A quiet aside, clarification, or framing note.
    These work well when they feel optional—but useful.
  </p>

  <!-- Section -->
  <h2>What This Changes in Practice</h2>

  <p>
    Translate theory → action.
    How should someone build, decide, or think differently after reading this?
  </p>

  <!-- Closing -->
  <p>
    Wrap with a grounded conclusion. No grand finales.
    Just a clean landing.
  </p>

    Thanks for reading. If this was useful, you’ll probably like the other posts too.
