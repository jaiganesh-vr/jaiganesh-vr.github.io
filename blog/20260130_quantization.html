  <p>
    Running large language models at scale is less about intelligence and
    more about logistics. Memory bandwidth, latency, and GPU cost tend to
    dominate long before model quality does.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quantization exists to close that gap. It reduces numerical precision
    inside a model to make inference faster and cheaper, while attempting
    to preserve as much capability as possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Quantization Without the Buzzwords</h2>

  <p>
    Quantization changes how numbers are represented inside a model.
    Instead of high-precision formats like BF16, the model operates using
    smaller representations such as FP8, INT8, or INT4.
  </p>

  <p>
    A useful mental model is lossy compression. Some numerical detail is
    discarded, but the overall structure remains intact. The trade-off is
    intentional: lower precision reduces memory usage and speeds up
    computation.
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    The open question has always been whether reasoning survives the loss.
  </p>

  <h2>Benchmark Setup</h2>

  <p>
    The benchmark evaluated a 32-billion-parameter Qwen model running on
    NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Thousands of inference runs were executed, alongside
    more than 12,000 questions from the MMLU-Pro benchmark.
  </p>

  <p>
    Multiple numerical formats were tested side by side, using BF16 as a
    baseline and comparing it against FP8, INT8, and INT4 variants.
  </p>

  <h2>Where the Speed Gains Come From</h2>

  <p>
    Lower-precision models consistently achieved higher throughput.
    The most significant improvements appeared with INT4.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not primarily because the math is cheaper. In modern LLM
    inference, memory movement is often the bottleneck. Smaller numerical
    formats reduce how much data needs to be transferred across the GPU,
    which directly accelerates generation.
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    Quantization improves performance by making memory behave.
  </p>

  <h2>Memory Is the Real Constraint</h2>

  <p>
    Model weights are only part of the memory story. During inference,
    language models rely heavily on the key-value cache, which stores
    intermediate representations for each token in the context.
  </p>

  <p>
    When model weights consume less memory, more space becomes available
    for the KV cache. This enables longer context windows, higher
    concurrency, or both.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, a 4-bit model can support several times the effective
    context capacity of a BF16 model under the same hardware constraints.
  </p>

  <h2>Accuracy Retention</h2>

  <p>
    Even aggressive quantization retained strong performance. INT4 models
    showed only minor degradation on reasoning-focused benchmarks compared
    to full-precision variants.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gap between numerical precision and task performance is smaller
    than intuition suggests. Large language models appear to contain
    significant numerical redundancy.
  </p>

  <h2>Cost as a First-Class Metric</h2>

  <p>
    Reduced memory usage and higher throughput combine into a substantial
    drop in inference cost. In some configurations, INT4 inference reduced
    cost per million tokens by more than half.
  </p>

  <p>
    For production systems, this often outweighs marginal accuracy
    differences. A slightly less precise model that is dramatically
    cheaper to run tends to win in real deployments.
  </p>

  <h2>Closing Thought</h2>

  <p>
    Quantization is no longer a niche optimization. It is a practical
    systems-level lever for making large models usable at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Progress in AI does not come only from larger models. Sometimes it
    comes from realizing how much slack already exists in the ones we
    have.

    Notes like these focus less on model novelty and more on the systems
    choices that determine whether models are usable in practice.
